# Vine City

Vine City is a virtual nation that exists solely online. It is an online community that allows individuals to engage in politics and activism, promoting a sense of community and belonging. Vine City's primary goal is to provide a platform for people who are passionate about politics and who want to engage in activism but are unable to do so due to physical or geographical constraints.
